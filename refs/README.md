# File and Data Format References

## Compilations, Collections, and Conglomerations

Here are existing projects/sites containing significant relevant references.

* [Gibbed.Sims4 GitHup repo](https://github.com/gibbed/Gibbed.Sims4) -
  Looks like a significant collection of information; I haven't rooted
  through all of it yet.  Last updated in 2014. Offered under the zlib
  license, according to the [GitHub license page](https://github.com/gibbed/Gibbed.Sims4/blob/master/license.txt).
  
  *  Looks like a lot of C# code implementing an object model and read
     & write operations for various file types / data structures. One
     can pretty much read the .cs files as format specs, but it's not
     completely 1-to-1.
	 
  * Includes the [EA Custom Content
    Guide](https://github.com/gibbed/Gibbed.Sims4/blob/master/misc/custom_content_guide/TS4%20Custom%20Content%20Guide.pdf),
    including 010 Editor binary template [files](https://github.com/gibbed/Gibbed.Sims4/tree/master/misc/custom_content_guide/BinaryTemplates).
